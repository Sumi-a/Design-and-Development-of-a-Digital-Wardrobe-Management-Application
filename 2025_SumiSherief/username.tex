%
% \documentclass{woosterthesis} must be at the beginning of every IS. Options are the same as
% for the report class with some additional options: abstractonly, acs, alltt, apa, blacklinks, chicago,
% code, colophon, dropcaps, euler, foreignlanguage, gauss, index, kaukecopyright, lshortwooster, maple, mla, palatino, picins,tikz,
% verbatim, wblack, and woostercopyright. The kaukecopyright option will put the arch symbol with the word mark on the
% copyright page. The woosterthesis class is based on the report class. One thing to note is that
% the ``%'' symbol comments out all characters that follow it on the line.
%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Checked on 8/26/22 and compiles with no fatal errors. Users must have the latest version of the TeXLive software and
% have installed all available packages from CTAN to ensure this thesis class compiles with no fatal errors. Also, you must
% run pdfLaTex, Biber, MakeIndex, padfLaTeX, pdfLaTeX to get all the numbering and references resolved. This is the
% first year the template uses Biber for references.

\begin{abstract}

This paper explores the development of \textit{My Digital Wardrobe}, a cross-platform application designed to address the challenges of managing a growing wardrobe, including disorganization, underutilized clothing, and inefficient outfit planning. The app enables users to upload, categorize, and mix-and-match clothing items, providing a streamlined approach to wardrobe management. By integrating cloud storage, it ensures accessibility across multiple devices, while React Native provides a minimalist and responsive user interface.

The design of the app emphasizes minimalism and responsiveness, ensuring ease of use while maintaining cross-platform compatibility. The current implementation allows users to manually categorize clothing into fundamental groups such as tops and bottoms. However, expanding these categories to include items like jackets and accessories would further enhance its functionality. User testing was conducted using Expo, with three tops and three bottoms selected from Pinterest to simulate real wardrobe items. The results confirmed that the app’s core features perform as intended, though additional personalization options could further improve the overall user experience.

\begin{acknowl}  
At the beginning of this journey, I had no idea how it would unfold. Yet, through every challenge and triumph, I am grateful for the guidance, patience, and love that have carried me forward.

First and foremost, I thank Allah, the most high,  for igniting the ambition within me, for His unwavering presence, for granting me patience in moments of doubt, and for surrounding me with love and strength.

I extend my deepest gratitude to my advisor, Dr. Visa—thank you for your patience, encouragement, and invaluable feedback, which allowed me to aim as high as I dared.

To my family—my parents, whose unwavering support has been the foundation of my success, and  my brothers, who constantly push me to work harder.

To my sister, who has always believed in me. Thank you for standing by my side, celebrating even the smallest accomplishments, and pouring love and courage into me.

To Lindu, my best friend, sharing classes and spending every moment of our senior year together has been an incredible experience. Your brilliant insights and our thought-provoking discussions have been a source of enlightenment, and I wouldn't trade them for anything.

To my best friends in the long distance,  Ranu, thank you for the daily calls that kept me grounded. Bitu, my confidant, your constant reassurance has meant everything. Nik, thank you for motivating me to achive my goals.

To my housemates, thank you all for making this journey even more special. Nk, your support means the world. Sipu, your friendship is a gift. Leul and Nebiyou, my late-night study partners, thank you for the company and unlimited snacks that kept me motivated through every long night.

As Wale once said, “Ambition is priceless; it's something that's in your veins.” This journey has been fueled by ambition, but I would not have made it here without the incredible people who lifted me along the way.
